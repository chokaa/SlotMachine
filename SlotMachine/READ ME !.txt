When u unzipped the folder, just open home.html in your browser. 
I'm not positive its compatible with every browser, i worked in
Google Chrome while developing game so i recommend it. Use case is
simple, just play the game :) When u are finished and want to play more
just refresh page. Just for the record, i could not find 12 normal icons
with same background color, thats why some icons have white 
background and some have gray, unfortunatelly.
